2. Steps for Integrating **Jacoco** in **IntelliJ IDEA**
- Integrate the dependency and plugin sections to relevant parts in your pom.xml from the pom.xml_fragment file below.
- Run **"mvn clean package"** to generate the results
- In IntelliJ, Select **"Analyse -> Show Coverage Data..."** and pick your Jacoco output file. This should be the path specified in the plug-in config i.e: _${basedir}/target/coverage-reports/jacoco-it.exec_ and _${basedir}/target/coverage-reports/jacoco-ut.exec_
- Output should be displayed in the IDE and you should also have the classes overlayed with test coverage.
